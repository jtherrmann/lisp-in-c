    // - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-38-anonymous-union-and-structure/
    //   - struct/union without tag is anonymous (its members can be accessed
    //     directly, in the scope where it was defined)
    // - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-c/
    //   - union is a struct whose size is determined by its largest member and
    //     whose members share the same memory location
    // - so below we declare an anonymous union, so its members can be accessed
    //   directly from the LispObject object, and the union has an int value
    //   and an anonymous struct, so we can directly access the int value AND
    //   both of the anonymous struct's members (car and cdr) all from the
    //   LispObject object; plus, the anonymous union's size is just large
    //   enough to hold its largest member (which must be the anonymous
    //   struct), and its members (the int value and the anonymous struct)
    //   share the same location in memory; so LispObjects that are treated as
    //   ints (i.e. their int value members are used, but not their car and cdr
    //   members) have some wasted space, but LispObjects that are treated as
    //   cons cells (their car and cdr members are used, but not their int
    //   value members) don't waste any space
    //   - so if we have a LispObject* called obj and we do obj->car, we are
    //     directly accessing obj's anonymous union member and then directly
    //     accessing the anonymous union's anonymous struct member and then
    //     accessing the anonymous struct's car member
